# ReinforcementLearningAlgoEvaluation

In the project of advanced machine learning course,
we study the theory and mechanism of two reinforcement
learning algorithms, A2C and PPO2 and their application for
multiple tasks e.g., Cart pole pendulum and lunar landing task.
To do so, we build up a pipeline able to train and manage
our models and environments. From the experimental results
obtained, we compute multiple reliability metrics to be able
to lead a discussion about the performance evaluation of the
algorithms.
